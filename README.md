ReDBox is an open source Research Data Management platform that assists researchers and institutions to plan, create and publish their research data assets.
ReDBox is one of the most popular research data management tools in Australia. It is currently in use across 12 Australian universities. ReDBox supports the Australian research community to describe and share information about research data collections. It assists data custodians in meeting institutional data management policies, applying the requirements of the [Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research](https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/r39), and publishing to [Research Data Australia](http://researchdata.ands.org.au/) (RDA), the national research data discovery system maintained by the [Australian Research Data Commons](http://ardc.org.au/) (ARDC).

The [Queensland Cyber Infrastructure Foundation](http://www.qcif.edu.au) (QCIF) leads the ReDBox development initiative and provides several services including a support subscription service to institutions.
